# DOT FILES
- Contains a backup of my bash profile file. (Mac Environment)
- Contains some aliases and functions which make life easier. Few are written on my own, others borrowed from friends on the world wide web.
- This also has a function that makes sure there's always a backup here, and makes a commit on every refresh of the file. Pushing can be done manually, or even via adding `git push --quiet 2> /dev/null`. I prefer a manual push whenever neccessary

PS: I Basically learnt from my mistakes, when I overwrote my dotfiles.
