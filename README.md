# DOT FILES
- Contains a backup of my bash profile file. (Mac Environment), zshrc file (mac environment again), and a bashrc file (ubuntu 18.04, linux environment)
- Contains some aliases and functions which make life easier. Few are written on my own, others borrowed from friends on the world wide web.
- This also has a function that makes sure there's always a backup here, and makes a commit on every refresh of the file. Pushing can be done manually, or even via adding `git push --quiet 2> /dev/null`. 
(I prefer a manual push whenever neccessary)

PS: I learnt from my mistakes, when I overwrote my dotfiles accidentally.
